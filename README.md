## 📋 Description
ignite is a streamlined framework designed to execute JavaScript and TypeScript microservices locally. It provides a secure Docker-based environment, allowing users to safely run untrusted code. Whether you are testing AI agents or developing code, ignite ensures your environment remains isolated and manageable.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with ignite, follow these easy steps. You do not need any coding experience. Just follow the instructions, and you will be running your application in no time.

### 📥 Step 1: Download the Software
To download ignite, visit the Releases page:

[Visit this page to download](https://github.com/NirmalLimbachiya/ignite/releases)

On this page, you will find the latest version of ignite. Click on the appropriate link for your operating system to start the download.

### 🖥️ Step 2: Install Docker
ignite requires Docker to run. If you do not have Docker installed, please follow these instructions:

1. Visit the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
2. Download the version suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Follow the installation steps provided on the website.

Once you have Docker installed and running, you are ready for the next step.

### 📦 Step 3: Set Up ignite
After you download ignite, follow these steps:

1. Locate the downloaded file, usually found in your "Downloads" folder.
2. Unzip the file by right-clicking on it and selecting "Extract" (or similar options based on your operating system).
3. Open the extracted folder. You will see a file named `ignite`.

### 💻 Step 4: Run ignite
To run ignite, you need to use your terminal or command prompt. Here are the steps:

1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
2. Navigate to the folder where `ignite` is located. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

   ```
   cd path/to/your/extracted/folder
   ```

3. Once you are in the correct directory, run the application:

   ```
   ./ignite
   ```

If you are using Windows, you may need to type `ignite.exe` instead.

### 🔧 Using ignite
ignite allows you to execute JavaScript and TypeScript code in a secure environment. You can run your commands directly in the terminal after starting the application. 

For example, to run a basic JavaScript app, type:

```
node your-app-file.js
```

This command assumes you have a JavaScript file named `your-app-file.js` in the same folder.

### ⚙️ Features
- **Local Execution:** Run your JavaScript and TypeScript codes locally without needing a server.
- **Secure Isolation:** Each microservice runs in its secure Docker container, minimizing security risks.
- **Easy Setup:** Simple instructions to get you started without technical jargon.
- **Support for Microservices:** Ideal for developing and testing AI agents and other microservice applications.

### 🔍 Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, consider the following:

- Ensure Docker is running. Check the Docker icon in your menu or taskbar.
- Verify you are in the correct directory when trying to run ignite.
- Restart your terminal and try again if faced with connection issues.
